# 📦 CodeCrunch: Building a Huffman-Based Compression-Decompression Utility with GUI Support

**CodeCrunch** is a Java-based desktop application that allows users to compress and decompress files using the Huffman Coding algorithm. Designed with a user-friendly GUI built using `Swing`, this tool provides an intuitive interface for file selection, compression, and decompression operations — making data handling more efficient and secure.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 Compress any text-based file using Huffman Coding.
- 🔓 Decompress previously compressed `.huff` files to restore original data.
- 🖥️ GUI interface with file chooser for easy navigation.
- 🧠 Demonstrates core **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.
- 🛠️ Built completely in Java with no external dependencies.

---

## 🧠 DSA Concepts Used

- **Greedy Algorithms**: Huffman Coding is a classic example of a greedy algorithm, optimizing file size reduction.
- **Priority Queue / Min-Heap**: Used to build the Huffman Tree by selecting the two nodes with the smallest frequency.
- **Binary Trees**: Huffman Tree is a binary tree structure where characters are represented by paths from the root.
- **HashMaps**: Used to store frequency counts and character-to-code mappings.
- **Recursion**: Tree traversal for encoding and decoding.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Compression Process**:
   - Reads the input file and calculates the frequency of each character.
   - Builds a Huffman Tree using a priority queue.
   - Generates Huffman codes for each character based on tree paths.
   - Encodes the data and writes it along with tree metadata into a `.huff` file.

2. **Decompression Process**:
   - Reads the `.huff` file, reconstructs the Huffman Tree from metadata.
   - Decodes the binary stream using the Huffman Tree to recover original data.
